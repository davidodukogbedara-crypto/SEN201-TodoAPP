PROJECT TITLE:
Simple To-Do List Application

INTRODUCTION
This project is a Simple To-Do List Application developed using Python programming language.
The application allows users to add tasks, view tasks, and delete tasks using a menu-driven system.
The project follows the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS
-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT
The system shall allow the user to add a new task.
The system shall allow the user to view all tasks.
The system shall allow the user to delete a task.
The system shall allow the user to exit the application.

-NON FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
The system shall be easy to use.
The system shall run on the command line.
The system shall be written using Python.

SYSTEM DESIGN
The system is designed as a menu-driven application.
Tasks are stored using a list data structure.
The program is divided into functions to improve readability and maintenance

FUNCTIONS USED
add_task() – adds a new task
view_tasks() – displays all tasks
delete_task() – deletes a task
main_menu() – controls the program flow

IMPLEMENTATION
The application was implemented using Python.
A list was used to store tasks entered by the user.
Each operation was implemented as a function.
The main_menu() function displays options and controls the program execution.

TESTING
The system was tested by adding tasks, viewing tasks, and deleting tasks.
All features worked as expected without errors.

DEPLOYMENT
The application is deployed by running the Python file using the command:
python todo_app.py

MAINTENANCE
The system can be improved in the future by adding file storage and a graphical user interface.

CONCLUSION
The Simple To-Do List Application was successfully developed using Python following the SDLC approach.
The project meets all the stated requirements.
